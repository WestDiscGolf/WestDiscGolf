#### [Using Dotnet CLI To Setup ASP.NET CORE Solution And Run With Tye](http:&#x2F;&#x2F;adamstorr.azurewebsites.net&#x2F;blog&#x2F;using-dotnet-cli-to-setup-aspnetcore-solution-and-run-with-tye) 
*I have always created more complex solutions, which are more than 1 project, through the friendly and familiar UI of Visual Studio. Now we have had multiple version of dotnet core and we are about to receive .NET 5 by the end of the year I thought it would be fun to see if I can setup a more involved solution purely on the command line.*
#### [Nullable Maths Readability](http:&#x2F;&#x2F;adamstorr.azurewebsites.net&#x2F;blog&#x2F;nullable-maths-readability) 
*I was asked by a friend at work what I thought about readabilty of nullable int maths and it got me thinking. How clever should it be over readability? Can developers understand what the code is trying to achieve quickly?*
#### [Autofixture Generate Specific Format Values By Extending AutoDataAttribute](http:&#x2F;&#x2F;adamstorr.azurewebsites.net&#x2F;blog&#x2F;autofixture-generate-specific-format-values-by-extending-autodataattribute) 
*Last time out we looked at how to write a custom specimen builder to generate a specific format of an identifier to fit with business requirements.*
#### [Autofixture Generate Specific Format with Specimen Builders](http:&#x2F;&#x2F;adamstorr.azurewebsites.net&#x2F;blog&#x2F;autofixture-generate-specific-format-with-specimen-builders) 
*I&#39;ve been using Autofixture on and off for years but got back into it quite heavily recently. Using it with the Xunit extension points and [Theory] attribute makes writing unit tests a joy.*
#### [Returning Different Values From A Method Call](http:&#x2F;&#x2F;adamstorr.azurewebsites.net&#x2F;blog&#x2F;returning-different-values-from-a-method-call) 
*I had to solve a problem a while back at work where I needed to call the same method multiple times but return different values in a known order. Now on the face of this it doesn&#39;t seem too bad however I had complete brain fog and reached out on Twitter. Dave Glick took the time to reply and it started to trigger ideas. Thanks Dave!*
#### [Why I love Resharper 2](http:&#x2F;&#x2F;adamstorr.azurewebsites.net&#x2F;blog&#x2F;why-i-love-resharper-2) 
*In my previous post about Resharper over 2 years ago I was looking at the constructor injection refactoring help. The other day I came across another one following on from that which I&#39;d not seen before.*
#### [Becoming a Remote Worker - Month 4](http:&#x2F;&#x2F;adamstorr.azurewebsites.net&#x2F;blog&#x2F;becoming-a-remote-worker-month-4) 
*Today marks the 4 month anniversary of becoming a full time remote worker due to the covid-19 pandemic.*
#### [Thoughts About Test Driven Development](http:&#x2F;&#x2F;adamstorr.azurewebsites.net&#x2F;blog&#x2F;thoughts-about-test-driven-development) 
*I think there is some general confusion about the benefits of Test Driven Development (TDD) but also when it&#39;s applicable. I&#39;m very much of the opinion that it doesn&#39;t always lend itself to everything you build. Now I&#39;m expecting a slight backlash on this but I believe its true. You should always test your code and have a suite of tests for the functionality once it&#39;s been built but to do &quot;pure&quot; TDD isn&#39;t always needed.*
#### [Becoming a Remote Worker - Week 16](http:&#x2F;&#x2F;adamstorr.azurewebsites.net&#x2F;blog&#x2F;becoming-a-remote-worker-week-16) 
*How is it July already? It&#39;ll be soon time for the schools to break up.*
#### [Optional Dependencies with Autofac](http:&#x2F;&#x2F;adamstorr.azurewebsites.net&#x2F;blog&#x2F;optional-dependencies-with-autofac) 
*I was asked at work the other day if it was possible for a dependency to be optional. Now my default position is probably but I&#39;d have to try and work it out. But also, why would you want to do that? So turns out that there is a valid reason.*
